The Student Grade Calculator is a console-based Python application designed to compute and categorize student grades based on their scores. Here's a breakdown of what it does:
Functionality
User Input Handling:
The program prompts the user to enter marks for different subjects.
It ensures that the input is valid (e.g., numerical values).
Grade Calculation:
It calculates the total and average score of the student.
Based on predefined grading criteria (e.g., A, B, C, D, F), it assigns a grade.
Conditional Logic:
The program uses if-elif-else statements to determine the grade based on the average score.
Example logic:
90-100: Grade A+
80-89: Grade A
70-79: Grade B+
60-69: Grade B
50-59: Grade C
40-49: Grade D
Below 40: Grade F
Displaying Results:
The final grade and score are displayed to the user.
Learning Outcomes
Improved understanding of Python fundamentals such as variables, loops, and functions.
Gained experience in handling user input and validating data.
Learned how to implement decision-making constructs (if-else statements) in Python.
